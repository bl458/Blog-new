# Michael's Blog

Below is a rough draft of a personal blog where I post about my interests.

## Basic features

1. About me
2. Feed
3. Post page
4. Post Create/Edit page

## Future features

1. Login for admin privileges
2. Public/private posts
3. Private to-do list page (Like Notes application on Mac)
4. Keyword search on feed & to-do list
5. Lazy loading of feed
6. Lightweight img placeholders with Blurhash algorithm

# Available Scripts
 
In the project directory, you can run:
 
### `npm start`
 
Runs the app in the development mode.
 
### `npm test`
 
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
 
### `npm run build`
 
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
